Relembrando programação web - Remember web development

The langueages/frameworks I'm using/pretend to use:
*Bootstrap 5
*HTML
*CSS
*PHP
*JavaScript

This is just a side project so I can remember what I've already learned of web development and also practice to learn even more

The goal is just develolment my skills as a programmer, I don't intend to publish a real website.

My intention is development Sing In/Login systems, Comments Area and a Contact Us Form. Also, I would like to development a system where people can publish texts on their profiles
I'm not sure yet, I just started this project... Let's see how it will grow.
